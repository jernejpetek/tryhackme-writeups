## Capturing the Silverpeas Login Request

Start by opening **Burp Suite** and keep the default options selected.

While Burp Suite is loading, enable **FoxyProxy** in the AttackBox browser so traffic is routed through Burp.

Once Burp Suite is open, go to the **Proxy** tab and make sure **Intercept** is set to **ON**.

Open the Silverpeas login page and enter the following credentials:
- **Username:** SilverAdmin
- **Password:** SilverAdmin

Then click **Log In**.

After clicking the login button, switch back to Burp Suite (if it doesn’t appear automatically). The intercepted request will be visible. Scroll to the bottom of the request and locate:

`Login=SilverAdmin&Password=SilverAdmin&DomainId=0`

Delete the `&Password=SilverAdmin` portion of the request so it only contains the username and domain.

Click **Forward**, then turn **Intercept** off.  
If successful, you should now have access to the Silverpeas main interface.
