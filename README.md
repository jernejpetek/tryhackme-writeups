# TryHackMe Writeups

This repository contains my personal write-ups for challenges, rooms, and labs completed on TryHackMe.  
The goal of this repo is to document my learning process and share explanations of techniques, tools, and methodologies used during hands-on practice.

## Purpose

These write-ups are shared for **educational purposes** only. They are intended to help others understand *how* problems can be approached and solved, not to encourage shortcutting or flag copying.

## Disclaimer

I do not support cheating or flag harvesting.  
If you choose to copy answers or flags without working through the challenges yourself, you are only cheating yourself out of the learning experience. The real value of these labs lies in understanding the process, not the final answer.
